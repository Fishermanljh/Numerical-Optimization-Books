# Numerical-Optimization-Books

### Aim
This repo is created to opensource some electronic books involving numerical optimization</br>
which I collected when I was struggling with the assignments of such a conceptual advanced</br>
mathematics course.

### Category:
1. Linear programming & Duality
2. Non-linear programming (Quadratic programming)
3. Convex Optimization
4. English Textbooks in numerical optimization
5. Chinese Textbooks in numerical optimization

6. My personal notes and refelction

### List of the materials uploaded:



As long as the opensource materials infringe on someone's copyright, I would delete it at once.

The materials in this repo is for educational purposes only. Do NOT spread it in any commercial
