# Numerical-Optimization-Books

### Aim
This repo is created to opensource some electronic books involving numerical optimization</br>
which I collected when I was struggling with the assignments of such a conceptual advanced</br>
mathematics course.

### Category:
1. Linear programming & Duality
2. Non-linear programming (Quadratic programming)
3. Convex Optimization
4. English Textbooks in numerical optimization
5. Chinese Textbooks in numerical optimization

6. My personal notes and reflection

### List of the materials uploaded:

As long as the opensource materials infringe on someone's copyright, I would delete it at once.

All materials in this repo is for educational purposes only. Do NOT spread it for any commercial 
purpose.

### Visualization 

[An Interactive Tutorial on Numerical Optimization](https://www.benfrederickson.com/numerical-optimization/) implements the
visualization of some commonly used methods in Numerical Optimization: Nelder-Mead, Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient...

Sebastian Ruder dives into [gradient descent methods](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) deeply, especially for 
> the stochastic gradient descent on large sparse models like those used to train deep neural networks.
